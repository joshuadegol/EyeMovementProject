# EyeMovement
# Description
This is a project that was put together with HTML, JavaScript and CSS to get familiar with CSS and what it does. Once loaded, the eye in the center of the screen should follow the cursor. 
# How use
First download the three files included in this repo into your own repository. Make sure all three are located in the same place.
Next, open the index.html file in a browser window. 
An eye should appear that follows your mouse as long as it's on the screen
